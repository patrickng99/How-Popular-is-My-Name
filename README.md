# How-Popular-is-My-Name

The purpose of this project is to allow the user to enter a name and then the program runs through a binary search tree to return some information about the name. The information displayed include:
Name: The first name or last name read from the input file.
Count: The number of times that name is used in the United States. 
Percentage: The percentage of people in the United States with that name.
Rank: The rank of the name in the top 1000 names. 

Three files called "male.txt", "female.txt", and "last.txt" are used. Within those files are all the above information. Each name is stored as a node in binary tree, and each node contains all the above information. The program then uses the binary search tree to return the information as it was requested by the user. If the name can't be found, the program returns an error message and gives the user a chance to make another search.
